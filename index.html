<p>The hospital in Abbotsford BC operates as part of the broader provincial healthcare system, coordinating with primary care providers, specialist referrals, and community health services to deliver integrated care. Services range from 24-hour emergency care for acute medical conditions to planned surgical interventions, advanced diagnostic testing, laboratory testing, and ongoing inpatient and outpatient management. Understanding how to access these services—whether through walk-in emergency visits, physician referrals, or pre-scheduled appointments—is essential for navigating the healthcare system effectively.</p>

<p>This site provides an overview of abbotsford healthcare facilities and the care pathways available at Abbotsford Hospital. It is important to note that the information presented here is educational and informational in nature. It is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always consult with qualified healthcare providers for medical concerns, and call 911 or visit the emergency department immediately if you are experiencing a life-threatening emergency. The content on this site is intended to help you prepare for visits, understand what to expect, and know what documents or information to bring, but it does not replace direct communication with hospital staff or your healthcare team.</p>

<p>Preparing for a hospital visit involves gathering relevant medical records, current medication lists, known allergies, and any requisition forms or referral letters provided by your physician. Arriving with this information helps clinical staff assess your needs more efficiently and ensures continuity of care. Whether you are visiting the emergency department, attending an outpatient clinic, or being admitted for inpatient hospitalization, having your health card, identification, and a summary of recent medical history readily available will facilitate smoother intake and registration processes.</p>

<p>Abbotsford Hospital's role within the regional health network means that many services require coordination with other healthcare providers. Specialist referrals, for example, typically originate from your family doctor or another clinician who identifies the need for advanced assessment or treatment. Diagnostic testing and medical imaging services are usually accessed through requisitions provided by your healthcare provider, and surgical procedures are scheduled following pre-admission assessments and consultations. Understanding these referral-based pathways helps set realistic expectations for wait times and appointment scheduling.</p>

<h2>Core patient care services</h2>

<section>
<h3>Emergency care Abbotsford: what to expect</h3>
<p>The abbotsford hospital emergency department operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to provide urgent and critical care for patients experiencing acute medical conditions, injuries, or life-threatening emergencies. Upon arrival, patients are assessed through a triage process that prioritizes care based on the severity and urgency of symptoms. This means that wait times can vary significantly depending on the volume of patients and the acuity of cases being treated. Patients with life-threatening conditions such as chest pain, difficulty breathing, severe trauma, or stroke symptoms are seen immediately, while those with less urgent concerns may experience longer waits.</p>

<p>If you are experiencing a medical emergency such as severe chest pain, loss of consciousness, major trauma, difficulty breathing, or signs of stroke, call 911 immediately rather than attempting to drive yourself to the hospital. Paramedics can begin life-saving treatment en route and notify the emergency department in advance, ensuring that the appropriate team and resources are ready upon your arrival. For urgent but non-life-threatening conditions, you may walk in to the emergency department, but be prepared for potential wait times based on triage priority.</p>

<p>When visiting the emergency department, bring your health card, a list of current medications, known allergies, and any relevant medical history or recent test results. Inform the triage nurse of all symptoms, when they began, and any factors that worsen or improve them. Honest and complete information helps clinical staff make accurate assessments and prioritize care appropriately. Family members or support persons may accompany you, but visiting policies and space limitations may apply depending on the situation and infection prevention protocols in place.</p>

<h3>Diagnostic testing and medical imaging services</h3>
<p>Abbotsford Hospital offers a comprehensive range of diagnostic testing and medical imaging services to support accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. These services include laboratory testing such as blood work, urinalysis, and microbiology cultures, as well as medical imaging modalities including X-rays, computed tomography (CT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and ultrasound. Access to these services typically requires a requisition from a physician or other qualified healthcare provider who has assessed your condition and determined that testing is medically necessary.</p>

<p>When you receive a requisition for diagnostic testing or imaging, read the instructions carefully. Some tests require specific preparation such as fasting for a certain number of hours, temporarily stopping certain medications, or drinking contrast agents. Arriving prepared ensures that the test can proceed as scheduled and that results are accurate. Bring your requisition form, health card, and identification to your appointment, and inform staff if you have any allergies, are pregnant, or have other medical conditions that may affect the procedure.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Patient preparation reminder: Always follow the specific instructions provided with your requisition. Fasting requirements, medication adjustments, and hydration guidelines are designed to ensure test accuracy and your safety during the procedure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Results from diagnostic testing and imaging are typically sent to the healthcare provider who ordered the test. Your doctor will review the findings and discuss the results with you, along with any recommended next steps for treatment or further investigation. If you have questions about your test or its purpose, ask your healthcare provider before the appointment so you understand what to expect and why the test has been ordered.</p>

<h3>Surgical procedures, inpatient hospitalization, and outpatient clinics</h3>
<p>Abbotsford Hospital provides a wide range of surgical procedures, from minor day surgeries to complex inpatient operations requiring extended hospitalization and recovery. Access to surgical services is referral-based: your family physician or a specialist will assess your condition and, if surgery is indicated, refer you to the appropriate surgical team. You will typically attend a pre-admission clinic where you undergo assessments, provide informed consent, and receive instructions on how to prepare for the procedure, including fasting guidelines, medication adjustments, and what to bring on the day of surgery.</p>

<p>Inpatient hospitalization is provided for patients who require ongoing medical or surgical care, monitoring, or recovery support that cannot be safely managed at home. Admissions may be planned, such as following a scheduled surgery, or unplanned, such as through the emergency department for acute illness or injury. During your hospital stay, a multidisciplinary team including physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and allied health professionals will coordinate your care, and discharge planning will begin early to ensure a safe transition home or to another care setting.</p>

<p>Outpatient clinics offer specialist consultations, follow-up appointments, and ongoing management of chronic conditions without the need for hospital admission. Specialist referrals are typically initiated by your primary care provider, who identifies the need for advanced assessment or treatment in areas such as cardiology, orthopedics, general surgery, or internal medicine. Wait times for outpatient appointments vary depending on the specialty, urgency of the referral, and current demand. Your referring provider or the hospital will contact you to schedule your appointment once the referral has been processed.</p>

<p>Understanding the distinction between referral-based access and walk-in access is important. Emergency department services are available on a walk-in basis for urgent and emergent conditions, but most other hospital services—including specialist consultations, elective surgeries, and diagnostic imaging—require a referral or requisition from a healthcare provider. This referral system ensures that resources are allocated appropriately and that patients receive care that is medically necessary and coordinated with their overall treatment plan.</p>

<section id="visiting-hours">
<h2>Hospital visiting hours and respectful visiting</h2>
<p>Hospital visiting hours at Abbotsford Hospital vary by unit and department, reflecting the different care needs and routines of patients in emergency, surgical, medical, and intensive care settings. Most inpatient units allow visitors during daytime and early evening hours, but specific times and the number of visitors permitted at one time may be restricted to ensure patient rest, privacy, and safety. It is important to check with the nursing station or unit clerk for the visiting policy applicable to the area where your family member or friend is receiving care.</p>

<p>Infection prevention and control measures may affect visiting policies, particularly during outbreaks of respiratory illness or other communicable diseases. Visitors may be asked to perform hand hygiene, wear masks, or limit the number of people at the bedside. These measures are in place to protect vulnerable patients, and compliance is essential. If you are feeling unwell, have a fever, cough, or other symptoms of illness, please postpone your visit until you have recovered to prevent the spread of infection within the hospital.</p>

<p>Respectful visiting includes keeping noise levels low, respecting the privacy of other patients in shared rooms, and following the guidance of healthcare staff regarding appropriate times for visits and the number of visitors. Patients need adequate rest to support healing and recovery, so be mindful of their energy levels and the clinical activities that may be taking place. If you have questions about visiting hours, policies, or how best to support your loved one during their hospital stay, speak with the nursing staff, who can provide guidance tailored to the specific unit and patient needs.</p>
